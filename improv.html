			<p><a href="http://theatrestrikeforce.org/">Theatre Strike Force</a> is UF's premier improv and sketch comedy troupe. The club was founded in 1989 and started in the School of Theatre and Dance. Today, TSF performs on campus at Gatornights, residence halls and other events, as well as at various locations around Gainesville.</p>
			
			<p>I joined TSF in the fall of 2010 and have been learning and performing improv ever since. I've performed in dorm shows, GatorNights! shows and other shows at places like the Hippodrome in downtown Gainesville. In spring of 2011 I became video documentarian for the club. My job was to record GatorNights! performances and any other shows for the historian to post on the website. I became chairman of the public relations committee for the club for the 2012-2013 school year and worked to promote all TSF shows on campus and fill out the show venue.</p>
			
			<p>Theatre Strike Force gave me a creative outlet to be funny, which I'm grateful for. It also gave me the tools to break out of the reserved shell I had in high school and be a more social and fun person to be around. Lastly, TSF gave me a group of friends that I always enjoy being around and can always make me laugh.</p>
